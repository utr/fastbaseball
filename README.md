*** Designed to show you innings in a baseball game that you can skip. 
*** This is useful if you want to watch a game on TV in a timely manner. 

- Currently designed to import game day play by play data from cbssports.com

- If no runs are present in the bottom half of the inning, then this is a possible inning to be skipped

- It then does a random calculation on the list with no runs, and outputs 3 innings that can be skipped and displays that to the user


TODOs:

- Allow interaction to enter in Date of Game and Teams Playing - This would then manipulate the URL that is scraped

- Distinguish between which team (away or home) that you are interested in skipping

- More to come!
